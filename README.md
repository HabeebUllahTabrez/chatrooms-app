# Amogus Chat Rooms

A full stack application which uses socket.io to communicate real-time inside chat rooms.

The frontend is created using react.js and the backend is created using node.js

The messages are stored in HarperDB, and upon entering a chatroom it fetches 100 recent messages in the room!
